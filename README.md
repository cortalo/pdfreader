# Synchronized PDF Reader

This app lets two devices read a PDF book together over Bluetooth with two reading modes:

**Mode 1 (Odd/Even)**: One device shows odd pages, the other shows even pages, like a real book. Tap advances by 2 pages.

**Mode 2 (Sequential)**: One device is always 1 page ahead of the other. Tap advances by 1 page.

Easily switch between modes during reading via the settings menu.

## Quick Start

**Setup (Do this once):**
1. Pair both devices in Android Bluetooth settings first
2. Download the apk from release. Install the app on both devices

**Start Reading Session:**

**Device 1 (Server):**
1. Open the app
2. Grant Bluetooth permissions if asked
3. Tap "Start Server"
4. Wait for "Device connected!" message

**Device 2 (Client):**
1. Open the app
2. Grant Bluetooth permissions if asked
3. Tap "Select Device"
4. Choose the server device from the list
5. Wait for "Connected!" message

**Both Devices:**
1. Tap "Open PDF Reader"
2. Select the same PDF file
3. Start reading together!

**Reading:**
- **Mode 1 (Odd/Even)**: Left device shows odd pages (1, 3, 5...), right device shows even pages (2, 4, 6...). Tap advances by 2 pages.
- **Mode 2 (Sequential)**: One device is 1 page ahead. Tap advances by 1 page.
- **Settings**: Long-press the PDF or use the menu to change reading modes on the fly.


## Features

### üì± Dual-Device Synchronization
- **Left-Right Page Layout**: One device displays left pages (odd numbers), the other displays right pages (even numbers)
- **Real-time Sync**: Navigation on one device automatically updates the other device
- **Role Assignment**: Server device shows left pages, client device shows right pages

### üîó Bluetooth Connectivity
- **Server Mode**: Start a server and wait for incoming connections
- **Client Mode**: Connect to paired devices with device selection dialog
- **Multiple Device Support**: Select from multiple paired devices when connecting
- **Auto-discovery**: Server mode makes device discoverable for easy pairing

### üìÑ PDF Viewing
- **Touch Navigation**: Tap to navigate through pages
- **High-quality Rendering**: Uses Android's PdfRenderer for crisp page display
- **File Picker Integration**: Easy PDF selection from device storage
- **Responsive Display**: Pages scale to fit screen size

### ‚öôÔ∏è Settings & Reading Modes
- **Dual Reading Modes**: Switch between Odd/Even and Sequential page modes
- **Instant Mode Changes**: Settings apply immediately without app restart
- **Easy Access**: Long-press PDF or use menu to access settings
- **Device Synchronization**: Mode changes sync automatically between devices

## How It Works

### Connection Setup
1. **Device A** (Server):
    - Grant Bluetooth permissions
    - Tap "Start Server"
    - Device becomes discoverable and waits for connections

2. **Device B** (Client):
    - Grant Bluetooth permissions
    - Ensure devices are paired via system Bluetooth settings
    - Tap "Select Device" and choose the server device
    - Connection established automatically

### Synchronized Reading
- **Server Device**: Shows left pages (1, 3, 5, 7...)
- **Client Device**: Shows right pages (2, 4, 6, 8...)
- **Navigation**: Tap on either device to move through the document
- **Automatic Sync**: Page changes are instantly reflected on both devices

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher
- Bluetooth capability on both devices
- Two Android devices for full functionality

### Setup Steps
1. Clone or download the project
2. Open in Android Studio
3. Build and install on both devices
4. Grant required permissions when prompted

### Required Permissions
- `BLUETOOTH` / `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` (Android 12+)
- `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN` / `BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE` (Android 12+)
- File access permissions for PDF selection

## Usage Guide

### First Time Setup
1. **Install** the app on both devices
2. **Pair devices** using system Bluetooth settings
3. **Launch** the app on both devices

### Starting a Session
1. **On Device 1 (Server)**:
    - Open the app
    - Tap "Grant Permissions" if needed
    - Tap "Start Server"
    - Wait for "Device connected!" message

2. **On Device 2 (Client)**:
    - Open the app
    - Tap "Grant Permissions" if needed
    - Tap "Select Device"
    - Choose the server device from the list
    - Wait for "Connected!" message

3. **On Either Device**:
    - Tap "Open PDF Reader"
    - Select a PDF file from your device
    - Begin synchronized reading!

### Navigation
- **Tap anywhere** on the PDF to navigate
- **Mode 1 (Odd/Even)**: Server device taps to go back 2 pages, client device taps to go forward 2 pages
- **Mode 2 (Sequential)**: Server device taps to go back 1 page, client device taps to go forward 1 page
- **Automatic sync**: Both devices update simultaneously
- **Settings access**: Long-press anywhere on PDF to open settings

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **BluetoothPairingActivity**: Handles device pairing and connection setup
- **MainActivity**: PDF rendering and synchronized navigation
- **SettingsActivity**: Reading mode configuration and preferences
- **BluetoothConnectionManager**: Singleton for connection state management
- **ConnectedThread**: Manages Bluetooth communication between devices

### Communication Protocol
- Uses RFCOMM (Serial Port Profile) for Bluetooth communication
- Simple text-based messages for synchronization:
    - `PAGE_CHANGE:n` - Notifies page navigation
    - `PDF_LOADED:n` - Confirms PDF loading with page count
    - `MODE_CHANGE:mode` - Syncs reading mode changes between devices

### PDF Rendering
- Utilizes Android's `PdfRenderer` class
- High-resolution bitmap rendering (2x scale)
- Efficient memory management with page caching

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- **"No paired devices found"**: Pair devices manually in Android Bluetooth settings
- **"Connection failed"**: Ensure server device is in server mode and discoverable
- **"Permission denied"**: Grant all Bluetooth permissions in app settings

### PDF Issues
- **"No file manager found"**: Install a file manager app from Play Store
- **"Error loading PDF"**: Ensure PDF file is not corrupted and accessible
- **Pages not syncing**: Check Bluetooth connection status

### Performance Tips
- **Large PDFs**: May take longer to load; be patient during initial loading
- **Battery**: Bluetooth communication may impact battery life
- **Range**: Keep devices within Bluetooth range (typically 10 meters)
